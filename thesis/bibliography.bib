	abstract = {We propose an adiabatic quantum algorithm capable of factorizing numbers, using fewer qubits than Shor's algorithm. We implement the algorithm in an NMR quantum information processor and experimentally factorize the number 21. Numerical simulations indicate that the running time grows only quadratically with the number of qubits.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2506.03241},
	abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational ansatz that resembles the Trotterized dynamics of a Quantum Annealing (QA) protocol. This work formalizes this connection formally and empirically, showing the angles of a multilayer QAOA circuit converge to universal QA trajectories. Furthermore, the errors in both QAOA circuits and QA paths act as thermal excitations in pseudo-Boltzmann probability distributions whose temperature decreases with the invested resource -- i.e. integrated angles or total time -- and which in QAOA also contain a higher temperature arising from the Trotterization. This also means QAOA and QA are cooling protocols and simulators of partition functions whose target temperature can be tuned by rescaling the universal trajectory. The average cooling power of both methods exhibits favorable algebraic scalings with respect to the target temperature and problem size, whereby in QAOA the coldest temperature is inversely proportional to the number of layers, \$T{\textbackslash}sim 1/p\$, and to the integrated angles -- or integrated interactions in QA.},
