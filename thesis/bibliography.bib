	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1411.4028},
	abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

	abstract = {Quantum integer factorization is a potential quantum computing solution that may revolutionize cryptography. Nevertheless, a scalable and efficient quantum algorithm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers looks far-fetched. We propose an alternative factorization method, within the digitized-adiabatic quantum computing paradigm, by digitizing an adiabatic quantum factorization algorithm enhanced by shortcuts to adiabaticity techniques. We find that this fast factorization algorithm is suitable for available gate-based quantum computers. We test our quantum algorithm in an IBM quantum computer with up to six qubits, surpassing the performance of the more commonly used factorization algorithms on the long way towards quantum advantage.},

	abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational ansatz that resembles the Trotterized dynamics of a Quantum Annealing (QA) protocol. This work formalizes this connection formally and empirically, showing the angles of a multilayer QAOA circuit converge to universal QA trajectories. Furthermore, the errors in both QAOA circuits and QA paths act as thermal excitations in pseudo-Boltzmann probability distributions whose temperature decreases with the invested resource -- i.e. integrated angles or total time -- and which in QAOA also contain a higher temperature arising from the Trotterization. This also means QAOA and QA are cooling protocols and simulators of partition functions whose target temperature can be tuned by rescaling the universal trajectory. The average cooling power of both methods exhibits favorable algebraic scalings with respect to the target temperature and problem size, whereby in QAOA the coldest temperature is inversely proportional to the number of layers, \$T{\textbackslash}sim 1/p\$, and to the integrated angles -- or integrated interactions in QA.},
