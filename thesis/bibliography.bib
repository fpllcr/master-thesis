	abstract = {We introduce a quantum algorithm that produces approximate solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

We find that this fast factorization algorithm is suitable for available gate-based quantum computers. We test our quantum algorithm in an IBM quantum computer with up to six qubits, surpassing the performance of the more commonly used factorization algorithms on the long way towards quantum advantage.},

This work formalizes this connection formally and empirically, showing the angles of a multilayer QAOA circuit converge to universal QA trajectories. Furthermore, the errors in both QAOA circuits and QA paths act as thermal excitations in pseudo-Boltzmann probability distributions whose temperature decreases with the invested resource -- i.e. integrated angles or total time -- and which in QAOA also contain a higher temperature arising from the Trotterization. This also means QAOA and QA are cooling protocols and simulators of partition functions whose target temperature can be tuned by rescaling the universal trajectory. The average cooling power of both methods exhibits favorable algebraic scalings with respect to the target temperature and problem size, whereby in QAOA the coldest temperature is inversely proportional to the number of layers, \$T{\textbackslash}sim 1/p\$, and to the integrated angles -- or integrated interactions in QA.},

	abstract = {The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is designed to run on a gate model quantum computer and has shallow depth. It takes as input a combinatorial optimization problem and outputs a string that satisfies a high fraction of the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied. For certain problems the lowest depth version of the QAOA has provable performance guarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better guarantees. Here we argue that beyond its possible computational value the QAOA can exhibit a form of Quantum Supremacy in that, based on reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device. We contrast this with the case of sampling from the output of a quantum computer running the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QADI) with the restriction that the Hamiltonian that governs the evolution is gapped and stoquastic. Here we show that there is an oracle that would allow sampling from the QADI but even with this oracle, if one could efficiently classically sample from the output of the QAOA, the Polynomial Hierarchy would collapse. This suggests that the QAOA is an excellent candidate to run on near term quantum computers not only because it may be of use for optimization but also because of its potential as a route to establishing quantum supremacy.},

Unfortunately, factoring via Shor's algorithm is well beyond the capabilities of today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we revisit the problem of factoring, developing an alternative to Shor's algorithm, which employs established techniques to map the factoring problem to the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. The proposed variational quantum factoring (VQF) algorithm starts by simplifying equations over Boolean variables in a preprocessing step to reduce the number of qubits needed for the Hamiltonian. Then, it seeks an approximate ground state of the resulting Ising Hamiltonian by training variational circuits using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We benchmark the VQF algorithm on various instances of factoring and present numerical results on its performance.},

The idea is tested by the transverse Ising model, in which the transverse field is a function of time similar to the temperature in the conventional method. The goal is to find the ground state of the diagonal part of the Hamiltonian with high accuracy as quickly as possible. We have solved the time-dependent Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation numerically for small size systems with various exchange interactions. Comparison with the results of the corresponding classical (thermal) method reveals that the quantum annealing leads to the ground state with much larger probability in almost all cases if we use the same annealing schedule.},
