\section{Shor's Factorization Algorithm}

First we have to briefly introduce the Shor's algorithm. We do not need a very detailed explanation, but it would be nice to provide a didactic discussion about the algorithm and its relevance. To this end, we can use the book by Nielsen and Chuang. In this section, we make clear that it is a gate-based way to do factorization.
