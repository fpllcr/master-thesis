\dropcap{T}his chapter explores two quantum approaches to the factorization problem. First, we review
Shor's algorithm and its quantum Fourier transform-based structure. Next, we introduce an alternative method for factorization based on adiabatic quantum computation, referred to as \textit{adiabatic factorization}~\cite{peng_quantum_2008}, which may serve as a potentially viable approach for factorization on analog quantum computers. We briefly discuss the limitations of this method, primarily arising from the implementation of many-qubit gates, which pose significant challenges in practical experimental settings. To address this issue, we present our solution in the form of a \textit{linearized adiabatic} Hamiltonian for factorization. Finally, we conclude this section with a discussion of the methods employed to implement each algorithm, setting the stage for subsequent comparisons and analysis.
