\label{Chapter:QAOAFactorization}


\dropcap{T}his chapter we introduce our results!!! To this end, we already can state here the problem of the many-body terms presented in the previous section. Then, we can be more clear in the next section.

\section{QAOA-based Factorization}

To exemplify our problematic, we can start by explaining how to implement the quadratic Hamiltonian. It would be interesting to show a quantum circuit to implement interactions of the form $ZZ$, $ZZZ$ and $ZZZZ$. If I'm not wrong, it is already done in the Nielsen-Chuang's book. In this way, we can say that \textit{the needed to avoid those terms if of pivotal interest to provide efficient quantum algorithms.}
