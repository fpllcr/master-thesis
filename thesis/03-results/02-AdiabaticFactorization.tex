\section{Adiabatic Factorization Algorithm}

To end, we introduce the adiabatic factorization protocol. In this section, we make clear that it is different from the gate-based version. To finish this section, we can already mention many-body terms that appear in the adiabatic factorization method. To this section, we can use the discussions done during the meetings, and the papers you used to learn about it.
