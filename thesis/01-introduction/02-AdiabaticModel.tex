\section{Adiabatic Quantum Computation}
\label{Section:AQC}


Talk here about adiabatic theorem and evolutions. Then, introduce the concept/definition of adiabatic quantum computation, where we define the problem Hamiltonians and etc. To this end, we can get results by Sarandy [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-004-7712-7] and references therein, and some discussion done in [Rev. Mod. Phys. 90, 015002 (2018)] to make our life easier.

\subsection{Adiabatic Quantum Annealers}

Here we discuss about the adiabatic quantum aneealers, where the problem Hamiltonian is the Ising Hamiltonian (which is the focus of our applications). To this end, maybe we can use the review paper to get some key discussions [Rev. Mod. Phys. 90, 015002 (2018)].
